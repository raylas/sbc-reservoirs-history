Logging reservoir level data from [rain.cosbpw.net](https://rain.cosbpw.net)

This repository archives the latest data from `https://rain.cosbpw.net/export/map/geojson/?method=sensors&sensor_class=94` every 20 minutes, if said data has changed.

Inspired by [Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/)
